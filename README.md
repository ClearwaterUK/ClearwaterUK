## Hi! üê¶

### I'm Clearwater, a half-English half-French programming blue bird.
I like to make and learn things and mess around with code, as well as modding games to add various kinds of content.
In 2022, I graduated from the University of Caen with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science, and am continuing my Masters studies in that field.
