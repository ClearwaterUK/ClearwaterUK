## Hi! üê¶

### I'm Clearwater, a half-English half-French programming blue bird/pegasus.
I like to make and learn things and mess around with code, as well as modding games to add various kinds of content.
In 2024, I graduated from the University of Caen with a Master's degree in Computer Science, and am now working/seeking work in software and Web development.

My main side hobby is creating mods and servers for various different games.
